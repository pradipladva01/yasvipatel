          <h3>Special Day</h3>
          <p>
            You’re really special to me someone who means a lot to me. The one
            who never misses a chance to tease me 👀, but also the one who’s
            always there when I need someone.You’re the one who checks in, asks
            ‘Is everything okay?’ and says, ‘If there’s a problem, just tell me,
            I’ll solve it.Even from a distance, you’ve made me feel heard and
            cared for (even if it sometimes feels like you care more about your
            friends than me 👀🥱), and never alone.
            <br />
            The way I feel around you is different. I don’t know how to explain
            it, but I just feel safe and relaxed with you like there’s no
            pressure, no responsibilities, just peace.
            <br />
            The bond we share is something else. It’s crazy how close we’ve
            gotten without even meeting yet.
            <br />
            I may have never said this before, but thank you for everything.
            You’ve done so much for me without me ever asking, and I’m truly
            grateful to have you in my life.
